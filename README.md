## About

Want to know if your favourite users has a Bluesky account? You can now easily visit https://aqfad.me/twitsky-users.

## How?

This website allows you to search their Twitter/X usernames to check if they're available on Bluesky. It uses a userbase which stores the username manually on my secure server.

## Why?

After so many people started switch to Bluesky, I always had a feeling where you didn't know their username on Bluesky since they would probably using a different usernames. Which is why I created this website to make it easier.
